## Background

### What are we doing here?

Given how heady weather is, I think it's best to start with a problem statement that gets at the heart of what GEM does.

> Given the current state of the atmosphere, what will be the future weather hours or weeks from now across different parts of the world.

### How are we going to do that?

We collect a bunch of observational data from different sources - satellites, weather balloons, surface stations, radar, aircraft - all sorts of stuff - we shove it all into a big equation and then we guess. This is called numerical weather prediction.

### Ok, but **how** does GEM do that?

Clear? If your reaction was like mine, probably not. I spent a lot of time reading to wrap my head around this so I'll break it down for you.

> "Horizontal variable-resolution cell-integrated finite-element discretization"

The model breaks the land and atmosphere into grid cells, like tiles on a map â€” but the cells can be smaller where you want more detail, like over mountains or cities, and larger where less precision is fine, like over the open ocean. *Cell-integrated* means we calculate the averages over each tile. You can imagine that over the tile there are all sorts of different values, but ultimately, while it reduces our accuracy a bit, we can instead take the average of all of them and use that. Obviously, the smaller the tile, the more accurate we get. *Finite-element* is a method for solving equations. If we have some irregular shape, we break it down into several simple shapes - e.g. a triangle. Once we have a bunch of triangles, we then solve the equation for each of those triangles instead, then we connect all  the pieces together, and then solve those simple equations.

> "the usual staggered finite differences discretization"

Ah yes, *the usual*. Usual here being subjective. Ok, this is a lot of math speak that basically means we would usually do a bunch of partial differentials to calculate the value. The problem is that calculating partial derivatives is expensive. What we do instead is look at all the weather and instead of calculating derivatives, we just look at what is happening nearby and calculate the delta between two points. While this is less accurate than calculating the derivative it is much faster.

> "in spherical geometry"

This one is a bit more straightforward. The Earth isn't flat (probably). GEM's math has to account for that. Ex: if wind is blowing long distances it has to curve; it doesn't blow straight.
