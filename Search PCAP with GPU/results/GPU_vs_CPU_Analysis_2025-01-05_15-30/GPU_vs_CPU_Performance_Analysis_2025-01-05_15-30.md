# GPU vs CPU Performance Analysis - January 5, 2025

## Executive Summary

This analysis examines the performance comparison between GPU-accelerated and CPU-only pattern matching algorithms across 25 comprehensive test scenarios. The benchmark tested various PCAP file sizes (50MB-1000MB), packet characteristics (small vs. large packets), and pattern counts (1, 7, 14 patterns) to evaluate real-world performance characteristics.

**Key Finding**: GPU performance is highly dependent on packet size characteristics, with large packets showing competitive performance while small packets consistently timeout on GPU implementations.

## Test Configuration

### PCAP Files Tested
- **Small Packet Files**: `synthetic_50mb.pcapng`, `synthetic_100mb.pcapng`, `synthetic_200mb.pcapng`, `synthetic_500mb.pcapng`, `synthetic_1000mb.pcapng`
- **Large Packet Files**: `synthetic_large_50mb.pcapng`, `synthetic_large_100mb.pcapng`, `synthetic_large_200mb.pcapng`, `synthetic_large_500mb.pcapng`

### Pattern Sets
- **1 Pattern**: HTTP
- **7 Patterns**: HTTP, GET, POST, Content-Type, User-Agent, Accept, Host
- **14 Patterns**: HTTP, GET, POST, Content-Type, User-Agent, Accept, Host, Cookie, Server, Date, Cache-Control, Connection, Keep-Alive, Transfer-Encoding

### Algorithms Used
- **CPU**: Boyer-Moore-Horspool (1 pattern), Aho-Corasick (multiple patterns)
- **GPU**: Boyer-Moore-Horspool (1 pattern), Vectorized Multi-Pattern (2-10 patterns), Aho-Corasick PFAC (10+ patterns)

## Performance Analysis

### 1. Small Packet Performance (139-43 byte average)

| File Size | CPU Time (s) | GPU Time (s) | Speedup | Status |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|---------|---------|
| 50MB      | 0.13-0.38    | 30.18-58.29  | 0.004-0.013x | ✅ Completed |
| 100MB     | 0.27-0.84    | 28.26-105.66 | 0.003-0.025x | ✅ Completed |
| 200MB     | 0.50-1.63    | 180.00+      | 0.003-0.009x | ⏰ Timeout |
| 500MB     | 0.51-2.12    | 180.00+      | 0.003-0.012x | ⏰ Timeout |
| 1000MB    | 0.84         | 180.00+      | 0.005x       | ⏰ Timeout |

**Analysis**: Small packets show catastrophic GPU performance degradation. GPU is 20-300x slower than CPU and consistently times out on files larger than 100MB.

### 2. Large Packet Performance (26KB average)

| File Size | CPU Time (s) | GPU Time (s) | Speedup | Status |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|---------|---------|
| 50MB      | 0.70-3.67    | 3.31-3.66    | 0.19-1.11x | ✅ Completed |
| 100MB     | 1.59-7.61    | 6.84-7.28    | 0.23-1.04x | ✅ Completed |
| 200MB     | 3.43-15.96   | 43.60-66.82  | 0.23-0.37x | ✅ Completed |
| 500MB     | 8.50-57.20   | 172.79-180.00+ | 0.05-0.32x | ⏰ Partial Timeout |

**Analysis**: Large packets show much better GPU performance, with competitive speeds on smaller files and gradual degradation on larger files.

### 3. Pattern Count Impact

#### Single Pattern (Boyer-Moore-Horspool)
- **CPU**: Consistently fast (0.13-8.50s)
- **GPU**: Variable performance based on packet size
  - Small packets: 30-180s (timeout)
  - Large packets: 3-173s (competitive to timeout)

#### Multiple Patterns (7 patterns - Vectorized Multi-Pattern)
- **CPU**: 0.36-57.20s (Aho-Corasick)
- **GPU**: 3.54-180s (timeout on large files)
- **Performance**: GPU competitive on large packets, poor on small packets

#### Many Patterns (14 patterns - Aho-Corasick PFAC)
- **CPU**: 0.38-42.19s (Aho-Corasick)
- **GPU**: 3.31-180s (timeout on large files)
- **Performance**: Similar pattern to 7-pattern tests

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Kernel Launch Overhead
- **Small packets**: High kernel launch frequency (7-106 launches)
- **Large packets**: Lower kernel launch frequency (2-8 launches)
- **Impact**: Each kernel launch has fixed overhead that becomes significant with many small operations

### 2. Memory Transfer Efficiency
- **Small packets**: Poor memory bandwidth utilization due to small payload sizes
- **Large packets**: Better memory bandwidth utilization with larger payloads
- **Impact**: GPU excels at processing large contiguous data blocks

### 3. Batch Processing Efficiency
- **Small packets**: Many small batches reduce GPU efficiency
- **Large packets**: Fewer, larger batches improve GPU efficiency
- **Impact**: GPU batch processing overhead dominates with small packets

## Algorithm Performance Comparison

### CPU Algorithms
- **Boyer-Moore-Horspool**: Excellent for single patterns, consistent performance
- **Aho-Corasick**: Efficient for multiple patterns, scales well with pattern count

### GPU Algorithms
- **Boyer-Moore-Horspool**: Good for single patterns on large packets
- **Vectorized Multi-Pattern**: Competitive for 2-10 patterns on large packets
- **Aho-Corasick PFAC**: Handles 10+ patterns but suffers from kernel launch overhead

## Validation Results

### Match Count Validation
- **Passed**: 15/25 tests (60%)
- **Failed**: 10/25 tests (40%)
- **Failure Pattern**: GPU timeouts result in 0 matches vs. CPU matches

### Timeout Analysis
- **Small packets**: 8/15 tests timed out (53%)
- **Large packets**: 2/10 tests timed out (20%)
- **Timeout threshold**: 180 seconds

## Conclusions

### 1. Packet Size is Critical
GPU performance is heavily dependent on packet characteristics. Large packets (26KB average) show competitive performance, while small packets (43-139 bytes) consistently fail.

### 2. File Size Scaling
GPU performance degrades significantly with file size for small packets, while CPU maintains consistent performance across all file sizes.

### 3. Algorithm Selection
- **Single patterns**: CPU Boyer-Moore-Horspool is superior for small packets
- **Multiple patterns**: CPU Aho-Corasick is superior for small packets
- **Large packets**: GPU algorithms can be competitive but require careful tuning

### 4. Practical Implications
- **Small packet workloads**: CPU is clearly superior
- **Large packet workloads**: GPU can be competitive with proper optimization
- **Mixed workloads**: CPU provides more consistent performance

### 5. Optimization Opportunities
- **Dynamic algorithm selection**: Choose CPU for small packets, GPU for large packets
- **Hybrid processing**: Use CPU for small packets, GPU for large packets
- **Kernel optimization**: Reduce launch overhead for small packet scenarios

## Recommendations

1. **Implement hybrid processing** that automatically selects CPU vs. GPU based on packet characteristics
2. **Optimize GPU kernels** to reduce launch overhead for small packet scenarios
3. **Consider CPU-only deployment** for workloads with predominantly small packets
4. **Use GPU acceleration** only for workloads with large packet sizes (>1KB average)
5. **Implement dynamic timeout** based on packet characteristics and file size

## Test Completion Status

- **Completed**: 25/30 tests (83%)
- **Remaining**: 5 tests (synthetic_large_1000mb.pcapng scenarios)
- **Next Steps**: Complete remaining tests to validate large packet performance at 1GB scale

## Methodology and Implementation

### Benchmark Framework

        # Aggressive GPU cleanup
        try:
            cp.get_default_memory_pool().free_all_blocks()
            cp.cuda.runtime.deviceReset()
        except:
            pass
        global timeout_reached
        timeout_reached = True
    
    timeout_thread = threading.Thread(target=timeout_handler)
