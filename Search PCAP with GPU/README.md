## Warning

I (Grant Curell) have written and edited this README. The docs that are in the sub-folders I let AI generate for me. From what I saw, they made sense and I primarily wanted a quick way to spin myself back up if I needed to come back to this, but heads up, I haven't written any of the docs aside from this one.

## Executive Summary

This project represents a comprehensive exploration of GPU acceleration for PCAP pattern matching across three distinct phases:

1. **Test 1:** CPU vs GPU comparison revealing fundamental packet size dependencies
2. **Test 2:** CUDA Boyer-Moore-Horspool implementation with simulation analysis  
3. **[Test 3](Test3_Final_GPU_Test_2025-09-12-13-00/HOW_NEWTEST_WORKS.md#executive-summary):** Optimized CuPy-based implementation achieving exceptional performance

Tests 1 and 2 I largely consider failures. The problem was I ended up launching too many GPU kernels leading to huge slowdowns. [Test 3](Test3_Final_GPU_Test_2025-09-12-13-00/HOW_NEWTEST_WORKS.md#executive-summary) I got right.

## Test Dataset Overview

### PCAP File Characteristics

The analysis uses synthetic PCAP files with two distinct packet size distributions to evaluate performance across different workload characteristics:

#### Small Packet Files (Standard Synthetic)
| File Size | Actual Size | Packets | Avg Packet Size | Total Bytes |
|-----------|-------------|---------|-----------------|-------------|
| **50MB** | 6.53 MB | 34,952 | ~180 bytes | 6.3 MB |
| **100MB** | 13.05 MB | 69,905 | ~180 bytes | 12.6 MB |
| **200MB** | 26.11 MB | 139,810 | ~180 bytes | 25.1 MB |
| **500MB** | 50.28 MB | 528,024 | ~180 bytes | 44.3 MB |

#### Large Packet Files (Synthetic Large)
| File Size | Actual Size | Packets | Avg Packet Size | Total Bytes |
|-----------|-------------|---------|-----------------|-------------|
| **50MB** | 50.9 MB | ~2,000 | ~26KB | 50.9 MB |
| **100MB** | 101.9 MB | ~4,000 | ~26KB | 101.9 MB |
| **200MB** | 203.8 MB | ~8,000 | ~26KB | 203.8 MB |
| **500MB** | 522.2 MB | ~20,000 | ~26KB | 522.2 MB |

### Pattern Sets Tested

#### Single Pattern
- **password** - Common authentication string

#### Seven Patterns  
- **password, GET, POST, HTTP, HTTPS, User-Agent, Authorization** - Web traffic patterns

#### Fourteen Patterns
- **Above plus: admin, login, session, token, malware, virus, exploit, vulnerability** - Security-focused patterns

### Dataset Characteristics Impact

- **Small Packets (180 bytes avg)**: High packet count, many small operations - challenging for GPU due to kernel launch overhead (though this is implementation dependent)
- **Large Packets (26KB avg)**: Low packet count, fewer large operations - optimal for GPU parallel processing
- **Pattern Density**: Varies by file type - small packets have higher pattern density per MB
- **Memory Access Patterns**: Large packets provide better cache utilization and memory bandwidth efficiency

| **Large Packets** | 100MB | 1.59-7.61s | 6.84-7.28s | 0.23-1.04x | ✅ Completed |

#### Critical Insights

- **Small packets (43-139 bytes):** GPU was 20-300x slower than CPU
- **Large packets (26KB average):** GPU showed competitive performance
- **Timeout issues:** 53% of small packet tests timed out at 180s
- **Algorithm dependency:** Performance varied significantly by pattern count

### Test 2: CPU Boyer-Moore-Horspool Implementation on CPU

**Approach:** Pure CPU Boyer-Moore-Horspool algorithm implementation

**Scope:** 12 test scenarios focusing on Boyer-Moore-Horspool algorithm optimization

**Key Finding:** Sequential pattern processing creates fundamental scaling limitations

#### CPU Implementation Results
| File Size | 1 Pattern | 7 Patterns | 14 Patterns |
|-----------|------------|------------|-------------|
| **50MB** | 61.78 MB/s | 6.11 MB/s | 2.74 MB/s |
| **100MB** | 59.66 MB/s | 5.49 MB/s | 3.04 MB/s |

#### Performance Scaling Analysis

- **1 → 7 patterns:** 61.40 → 6.12 MB/s (10x degradation)
- **7 → 14 patterns:** 6.12 → 3.07 MB/s (2x degradation)  
- **1 → 14 patterns:** 61.40 → 3.07 MB/s (20x degradation)

#### Root Cause Analysis

Here are some things we could have done to make this go a bit faster that I didn't do.

- **Sequential processing:** Each pattern required full dataset scan on CPU
- **Memory inefficiency:** Repeated access to same data with poor cache utilization
- **Algorithm limitation:** Boyer-Moore-Horspool designed for single patterns
- **CPU-only implementation:** Pure Python implementation with Scapy PCAP loading
- **Pattern scaling:** Linear degradation - 14 patterns = 14x more work
- **No parallelization:** Patterns processed one at a time, not simultaneously

### [Test 3](Test3_Final_GPU_Test_2025-09-12-13-00/HOW_NEWTEST_WORKS.md#executive-summary): Optimized CuPy Implementation

**Approach:** Optimized CuPy-based implementation with adaptive algorithms

**Scope:** 28 test scenarios across 10 PCAP files and 3 pattern counts

| **Small Packets** | 1000MB | 2,570 MB/s | 639 MB/s | 385 MB/s |
| **Large Packets** | 50MB | 1,358 MB/s | 277 MB/s | 148 MB/s |
| **Large Packets** | 100MB | 1,967 MB/s | 298 MB/s | 156 MB/s |
| **Large Packets** | 200MB | 2,514 MB/s | 315 MB/s | 158 MB/s |
| **Large Packets** | 500MB | **2,741 MB/s** | 313 MB/s | 159 MB/s |

#### Key Achievements

- **GPU Implementation:** CuPy-based scanner with dynamic algorithm selection
- **CPU Implementation:** Boyer-Moore-Horspool and Aho-Corasick algorithms
- **Test Matrix:** 30 scenarios (10 PCAP files × 3 pattern counts [1, 7, 14])

#### Technical Implementation

if pattern_count == 1:
    algorithm = "Boyer-Moore-Horspool"
elif pattern_count <= 10:
    algorithm = "Vectorized Multi-Pattern"
else:
    algorithm = "Aho-Corasick (PFAC)"

# Dynamic batching based on payload count
if total_payloads < 1000:
    batch_size = 100
elif total_payloads < 10000:
    batch_size = 500
else:
    batch_size = 1000
```

#### Some Notes

- **Sequential Processing:** Each pattern scanned entire dataset individually
- **Pure CPU Approach:** No GPU acceleration or simulation

#### Technical Implementation
```python
# Sequential CPU processing - pure Python Boyer-Moore-Horspool
class BoyerMooreHorspool:
    def find_all_matches(self, text: bytes, packet_id: int, pattern_id: int):
        matches = []
        i = 0
        while i <= len(text) - self.pattern_len:
            # Check if pattern matches at position i
            j = self.pattern_len - 1
            while j >= 0 and self.pattern[j] == text[i + j]:
                j -= 1
            if j < 0:
                matches.append(Match(packet_id, i, pattern_id))
                i += self.pattern_len  # Skip by pattern length
            else:
                # Use bad character rule to skip
                bad_char = text[i + self.pattern_len - 1]
                shift = self.bad_char_table.get(bad_char, self.pattern_len)
                i += max(1, shift)
        return matches

# Sequential processing loop
for packet_id, packet_data in enumerate(packets_data):
    for pattern_id, matcher in enumerate(self.bmh_matchers):
        matches = matcher.find_all_matches(packet_data, packet_id, pattern_id)
        all_matches.extend(matches)
```

    # Use Boyer-Moore-Horspool for each pattern individually
    for pid, p in enumerate(patterns):
        # Process each pattern individually
else:  # If many patterns (like 14+)
    # Use PFAC (Parallel Finite Automaton for Content) 
    pf = PFAC(patterns)
    # Process all patterns simultaneously
```

#### Key Features
- **CSV output:** Comprehensive results with timing and throughput metrics
- **No individual match printing:** Focused on performance measurement
- **Load time separation:** Distinct timing for CPU load vs GPU search
- **Throughput calculation:** MB/s excluding load time

## Conclusions from the Information

### 1. Packet Size is the Critical Factor
**Finding:** GPU performance is fundamentally dependent on packet characteristics, not just file size.

**Evidence:**
- **Small packets (43-139 bytes):** Consistently poor GPU performance across all Tests
- **Large packets (26KB average):** Excellent GPU performance in [Test 3](Test3_Final_GPU_Test_2025-09-12-13-00/HOW_NEWTEST_WORKS.md#executive-summary)
- **Test 1:** GPU was 20-300x slower than CPU for small packets
- **[Test 3](Test3_Final_GPU_Test_2025-09-12-13-00/HOW_NEWTEST_WORKS.md#executive-summary):** Large packets achieved 2,741 MB/s peak throughput

**Implication:** Packet size characteristics must be considered when choosing CPU vs GPU processing.

### 2. Algorithm Selection is Crucial
**Finding:** Different algorithms perform optimally for different pattern counts.

**Evidence:**
- **Test 2:** Sequential CPU BMH showed 20x degradation with multiple patterns
- **[Test 3](Test3_Final_GPU_Test_2025-09-12-13-00/HOW_NEWTEST_WORKS.md#executive-summary):** Adaptive BMH/PFAC selection maintained performance
- **Single patterns:** BMH excels (2,741 MB/s peak)
- **Multiple patterns:** PFAC prevents severe degradation

**Implication:** Dynamic algorithm selection based on pattern count is essential for optimal performance.

### 3. Implementation Quality Matters Enormously
**Finding:** Implementation approach dramatically affects performance outcomes.

**Evidence:**
- **Test 1:** GPU was often slower than CPU
- **Test 2:** CPU implementation showed 61 MB/s peak
- **[Test 3](Test3_Final_GPU_Test_2025-09-12-13-00/HOW_NEWTEST_WORKS.md#executive-summary):** Achieved 2,741 MB/s peak (45x improvement over CPU implementation)

**Implication:** Proper GPU optimization can achieve exceptional performance gains.

### 4. File Size Scaling Characteristics
**Finding:** Performance scales differently based on implementation quality.

**Evidence:**
- **Test 1:** GPU performance degraded severely with file size
- **Test 2:** Consistent ~61 MB/s across all file sizes (CPU implementation)
- **[Test 3](Test3_Final_GPU_Test_2025-09-12-13-00/HOW_NEWTEST_WORKS.md#executive-summary):** Performance increases with file size up to ~500MB, then plateaus potentially. More experimentation is needed

**Implication:** Well-optimized implementations can maintain or improve performance with larger files.

### 5. Multi-Pattern Processing Challenges
**Finding:** Multiple pattern processing presents fundamental challenges.

**Evidence:**
- **Test 2:** Sequential CPU processing caused 20x degradation
- **[Test 3](Test3_Final_GPU_Test_2025-09-12-13-00/HOW_NEWTEST_WORKS.md#executive-summary):** Adaptive algorithms reduced degradation to 50-80%
- **Pattern scaling:** Performance degrades exponentially with pattern count

**Implication:** Multi-pattern workloads require specialized algorithms and careful optimization.

## Detailed Reasoning for Results

### Why Test 1 Showed Poor GPU Performance

#### 1. Kernel Launch Overhead

**Root Cause:** Small packets required many kernel launches (7-106 per test)<br>
**Impact:** Each kernel launch has fixed overhead that becomes significant with many small<br> operations
**Evidence:**<br> 
- Small packets: 7-106 kernel launches
- Large packets: 2-8 kernel launches
- Performance correlation with launch count

#### 2. Memory Transfer Inefficiency

**Root Cause:** Small packet payloads don't utilize GPU memory bandwidth effectively<br>
**Impact:** GPU excels at processing large contiguous data blocks, not many small fragments<br>
**Evidence:**
- Small packets: 43-139 byte average
- Large packets: 26KB average
- 200x difference in packet size correlates with performance difference

#### 3. Batch Processing Overhead
**Root Cause:** Many small batches reduce GPU efficiency<br>
**Impact:** GPU batch processing overhead dominates with small packets<br>
**Evidence:**
- Dynamic batching attempted to optimize but couldn't overcome fundamental limitations
- Small packet workloads inherently unsuitable for GPU processing

### Why Test 2 Showed Sequential Scaling Issues

#### 1. Algorithm Design Limitation

**Root Cause:** Boyer-Moore-Horspool designed for single pattern matching<br>
**Impact:** Each additional pattern requires full dataset scan on CPU<br>
**Evidence:**
```python
for pattern_id, matcher in enumerate(self.bmh_matchers):
    matches = matcher.find_all_matches(packet_data, packet_id, pattern_id)
    all_matches.extend(matches)
```

#### 2. CPU-Only Implementation

**Root Cause:** Pure Python implementation with Scapy PCAP loading<br>
**Impact:** Limited to CPU processing power and Python interpretation overhead<br>
**Evidence:**
- No CuPy/CUDA usage despite availability
- Sequential CPU processing only
- Python overhead for string matching operations
- Scapy library for PCAP parsing adds overhead

#### 3. Memory Access Pattern Inefficiency

**Root Cause:** Repeated access to same data with poor cache utilization<br>
**Impact:** Memory bandwidth wasted on redundant data access<br>
**Evidence:**
- Single pattern: Optimal memory access
- Multiple patterns: Repeated access to same data
- Cache efficiency decreases with pattern count
