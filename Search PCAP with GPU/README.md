# GPU-Accelerated PCAP Scanner: Comprehensive Analysis Report

**Project Overview:** This repository contains three distinct approaches to GPU-accelerated PCAP pattern matching, each used a different strategy with different code.

---

## Executive Summary

This project represents a comprehensive exploration of GPU acceleration for PCAP pattern matching across three distinct phases:

1. **Test 1:** CPU vs GPU comparison revealing fundamental packet size dependencies
2. **Test 2:** CUDA Boyer-Moore-Horspool implementation with simulation analysis  
3. **Test 3:** Optimized CuPy-based implementation achieving exceptional performance

Tests 1 and 2 I largely consider failures. The problem was I ended up launching too many GPU kernels leading to huge slowdowns. Test 3 I got right.

**Impact:** Each kernel launch has fixed overhead that becomes significant with many small operations
**Evidence:** 
- Small packets: 7-106 kernel launches
- Large packets: 2-8 kernel launches
- Performance correlation with launch count

#### 2. Memory Transfer Inefficiency
**Root Cause:** Small packet payloads don't utilize GPU memory bandwidth effectively
**Impact:** GPU excels at processing large contiguous data blocks, not many small fragments
**Evidence:**
- Small packets: 43-139 byte average
- Large packets: 26KB average
- 200x difference in packet size correlates with performance difference

#### 3. Batch Processing Overhead
**Root Cause:** Many small batches reduce GPU efficiency
**Impact:** GPU batch processing overhead dominates with small packets
**Evidence:**
- Dynamic batching attempted to optimize but couldn't overcome fundamental limitations
- Small packet workloads inherently unsuitable for GPU processing

### Why Test 2 Showed Sequential Scaling Issues

#### 1. Algorithm Design Limitation
